<b><i>I have a android device with ics(4.0+), why does the widget not apear in the widget list?</i></b> <br>
ICS has a strange bug which causes freshly installed widgets to not apear in the list. This can be fixed by rebooting the device. Restarting the launcher app, seems to fix this also.<br>

<b><i>I have a android device with an os version older than 4.0 why is the widget not apearing in the widget list?</i></b> <br>
This happens when your device allows you to directly install new apps on the sdcard instead of the internal memory. Widgets don't work when they are installed to the sdcard. This is often a feature of custom roms, so make sure to deactivate this feature when installing widgets.
